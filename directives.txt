Extra notes:
The name of the game is "Bars Reborn".
The game will be made in plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
The game will have a modern UI.
In scripts, DOM Content will already be loaded, sice they are injected.

TODO Procedure: Do the part labeled First, while keeping in mind the Later part.

Current TODO:

First: 
Make a title screen where you will have a selector to select a previous save (Saved by gameSave.js) and a new game button.
The switch between the title screen and the game will be done by the multiPage.js library.

Later:
This is an incremental game where you have bars that load every 10 seconds and give you loads, which is the currency of the game.
Then there will be upgrades that give you more bars and an upgrade that increases the loads you get.
